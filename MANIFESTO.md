# ⚡ Flow AI Manifesto

**"Pre-processing (下処理) × Speed (速度)"**

## 1. The Core Philosophy

This product is NOT a chat bot. It is an **Ingredient Pre-processor**.
Its sole purpose is to prepare raw text (ingredients) for downstream consumption (cooking) by LLMs or Humans.

* **Don't Overcook**: We do not create content. We clean, clarify, and enhance.
* **The "Salt" Principle**: Like salting a fish, our changes should be fundamental and enhancing, not overpowering.
* **Zero Friction**: The user should feel no resistance. Input -> Flow -> Output.

## 2. The Speed Mandate

**Speed is our lifeline.**
Because we are a "pre-step", we must be instant. Any latency kills the flow.

* **Model**: Always prefer **Gemini Flash** (or equivalent fastest model). High intelligence is secondary to low latency.
* **Tokens**: Keep system prompts minimal. Every token counts.
* **Logic**: Avoid complex routing unless absolutely necessary.

## 3. The Spectrum (Seasoning)

We do not use discrete "Styles". We use a **Seasoning Spectrum (0-100)**.

* **0-30 (Salt)**: Restoration. Typos, format, punctuation. **Fastest.**
* **31-70 (Sauce)**: Clarity. Context supplementation. **Fast.**
* **71-100 (Spice)**: Enhancement. Creative bridging. **Balanced.**
